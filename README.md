An example of what would go in databaseconfig.py:
secretkey = '1111'
username = 'admin'
password = 'default'

An example of what would go in .env if you are running this in a virtual
environment with foreman (as per the heroku tutorial):
secrekey=1111

Hmm, comitting this to github and production on heroku introduced a lot of files.
